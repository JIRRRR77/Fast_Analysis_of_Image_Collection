# Fast Analysis of Image Collection

#1.Scope of your project
The main task of our project is to figure out which images should be labeled
first, and which images contribute more to training our model. Kind of like
evaluating the images dataset. And at the end of the project, we are supposed
to get the score for each image and its ranking, the images with higher scores
should be labeled with priority.
