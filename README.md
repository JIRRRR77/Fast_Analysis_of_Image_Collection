# Fast Analysis of Image Collection
Supervisor: Dr. Jens Pontow

Affiliation: Daimler Center for Automotive IT Innovations, Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

# Scope of the project

The main task of our project is to figure out which images should be labeled
first, and which images contribute more to training our model. Kind of like
evaluating the images dataset. And at the end of the project, we are supposed
to get the score for each image and its ranking, the images with higher scores
should be labeled with priority.

See detail on the presentation slide and paper; programming part in branch master.
